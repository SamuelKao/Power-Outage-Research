# Power-Outage-Research
## Introduction

My partner and I are planning to conduct analysis on the outages dataset. It seems the most relevant and has real world applications; thus, we believe the power outages dataset to be the most appealing.

There are various questions that we can explore when it comes to this dataset. Here are a few of them.

- Which factors most heavily contribute to increasing the duration of a power outage?

- Do different regions/states have different distributions in the number of power outages that they experience?

- Has there been an increase in the number of power outages across the United States due to the increase of rapid urbanization?
